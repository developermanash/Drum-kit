# DRUM-KIT

This project is a simple drum kit created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the concept of DOM manipulation, where JavaScript is used to interact with and modify elements in an HTML document.

# Features:

Interactive interface: Users can click on different drum pads to trigger corresponding sounds.
Realistic sound effects: The project includes various drum sounds to create a realistic drumming experience.
Visually appealing design: The drum kit is designed with a clean and intuitive layout.
Getting Started:

# Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone: https://github.com/developermanash/Drum-kit
Use code with caution.

Open the project: Navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in a web browser.
How it works:

HTML structure: The HTML file defines the basic structure of the drum kit, including the drum pads and audio elements for each sound.
CSS styling: The CSS file styles the drum kit, giving it a visually appealing appearance.
JavaScript logic: The JavaScript file handles the interaction between the user and the drum kit. It listens for click events on the drum pads and triggers the corresponding sound using the audio elements.
